In most programming languages, the right shift operator (>>) preserves the sign of a signed integer when performing a right shift.

When a signed integer is right-shifted, the most significant bit (MSB) is used as the sign bit. If the sign bit is 0, the number is positive, and if the sign bit is 1, the number is negative.

During a right shift operation on a signed integer, the sign bit is copied to fill in the vacant bit positions that are shifted in from the left. This ensures that the sign of the number is preserved.

For example, let's consider a signed integer -8 in binary representation:
Decimal: -8
Binary:  11111111111111111111111111111000
If we perform a right shift by 1 position (-8 >> 1), the sign bit (MSB) is copied to fill in the vacant bit position on the left:
Binary:  11111111111111111111111111111100
The resulting binary representation is still a negative number, indicating that the sign of -8 is preserved after the right shift operation.

Therefore, in most programming languages, the right shift operator preserves the sign of a signed integer.


Problem 1

byte x = 64
int i
byte y
i = x << 2
y = byte(x << 2)
print(i, y)
Explanation:

x is assigned the value of 64.
i and y are initially assigned 0.
i is updated by performing a left shift (<<) operation on x by 2 positions. This means x is multiplied by 2 raised to the power of 2 (4). So, i becomes 256 (64 * 2 * 2).
y is updated by performing a left shift (<<) operation on x by 2 positions. However, since y is declared as a byte, which can only hold values from -128 to 127, we need to ensure the value fits within this range. So, we apply a bitwise AND (&) operation with 0xFF, which is the hexadecimal representation of 255 in decimal. This operation ensures that only the least significant 8 bits are retained, effectively reducing the value to fit within a byte.
Finally, we print the values of i and y, which will be 256 and 0, respectively.
Keep in mind that the exact behavior of data types may vary depending on the programming language you are using, so please adapt the code accordingly to your specific language



Problem2

It appears that there are a few syntax errors in the code you provided. Here's the corrected version:
var1 = 42
var2 = ~var1
print(var1, var2)
Explanation:
- `var1` is assigned the value of 42.- `var2` is assigned the bitwise complement of `var1`. The `~` operator performs a bitwise negation, flipping each bit in the binary representation of the operand.
- Finally, we print the values of `var1` and `var2`.When you execute this code, the output will be:
42 -43
Therefore, `var1` remains as 42, and `var2` becomes -43 after applying the bitwise complement operator `~` to `var1`.
