the left shift operator (<<) can be used as an alternative to multiplying a number by 2. Shifting a binary number to the left by one position effectively doubles its value. Similarly, if you left-shift a number by n positions (x << n), it is equivalent to multiplying the number by 2 raised to the power of n.

It's important to note that using the left shift operator as an alternative to multiplication by 2 is generally faster and more efficient in terms of computational resources.




Based on the given statements:
a=1 
b=2
c=3, 
a|=4 	b>>=1. 	c<<=1, 	a^=c 
print(a,b,c)
Let's go through the remaining statements step by step:

1. `a |= 4`: The `|=` operator performs a bitwise OR operation between `a` and 4, and then assigns the result back to `a`. 

   In binary representation, `a` is 0001, and 4 is 0100. Performing a bitwise OR operation on these two values gives us 0101, which is 5 in decimal. So, `a` is updated to 5.

2. `b >>= 1`: The `>>=` operator performs a right bitwise shift operation on `b` by 1 position, and then assigns the result back to `b`. 

   In binary representation, `b` is 0010. Shifting it one position to the right gives us 0001, which is 1 in decimal. So, `b` is updated to 1.

3. `c <<= 1`: The `<<=` operator performs a left bitwise shift operation on `c` by 1 position, and then assigns the result back to `c`. 

   In binary representation, `c` is 0011. Shifting it one position to the left gives us 0110, which is 6 in decimal. So, `c` is updated to 6.

4. `a ^= c`: The `^=` operator performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `c`, and then assigns the result back to `a`. 
   In binary representation, `a` is 0101, and `c` is 0110. Performing a bitwise XOR operation on these two values gives us 0011, which is 3 in decimal. So, `a` is updated to 3.
After executing all the statements, the final values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are:
